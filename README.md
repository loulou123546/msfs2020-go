## Why does my virus-scanning software think this program is infected?

From official golang website https://golang.org/doc/faq#virus

"This is a common occurrence, especially on Windows machines, and is almost always a false positive. Commercial virus scanning programs are often confused by the structure of Go binaries, which they don't see as often as those compiled from other languages."
